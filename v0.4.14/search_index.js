This distribution is typically used to represent a fixed value in the parameter space and is often used in Bayesian inference to represent a parameter that is known with certainty.\n\nWarning\n\nThe logpdf always returns zero. This is because its purpose is to represent a fixed value in  the parameter space, and thus we do not want it to directly compute to the probability density of the posterior. \n\nExample\n\njulia> d = DeltaDist(5.0)\njulia> rand(d) == 5.0\ntrue\njulia> logpdf(d, 0.0)\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#HypercubeTransform.NamedDist-Union{Tuple{NamedTuple{N}}, Tuple{N}} where N","page":"Home","title":"HypercubeTransform.NamedDist","text":"NamedDist(d::NamedTuple{N})\nNamedDist(;dists...)\n\nA Distribution with names N.
